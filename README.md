# Fingerspelling Recognition
This repository contains the essentials for building an extremely simple, down-to-earth model builder that may barely be qualified to be called as a neural network.

Here's how to get you started on copying all of the below tutorial codes. Run the below code to clone this repository onto your local computer.  
`git clone https://github.com/cheewoei1997/computer-vision.git`

Once you've cloned, just navigate to the folder that you have cloned and you're all set.

## Report
Softcopy for the entire assignment. [Click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18fNFAAApZsf-IpOdQJnFr_5nA9hKI9MN4nz6XeSQ7DI/edit?usp=sharing).

## Python 101
Look up on simple examples on how Python actually works using Jupyter Notebook.

### Tutorials
1. [Passing Data](../master/python-101/passingData.ipynb)  
Work with lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
2. [Control Flow Tools](../master/python-101/controlFlowTools.ipynb)  
Play with if-else statements and other built-in functions.
3. [Functions and Matrices](../master/python-101/functionsAndMatrices.ipynb)  
Passing parameters using functions and arguments.
4. [Genetic Algorithms](../master/python-101/geneticAlgorithms.ipynb)  
Discover how these algorithms iterate until the right answer.
5. [Ensemble Methods](../master/python-101/ensembleMethods.ipynb)  
We discover different ways of training a model here.
5. [Hidden Markov Model](../master/python-101/hiddenMarkovModel.ipynb)  
The model computes future sitautions without thinking of the past.
5. [Reinforcement Learning](../master/python-101/reinforcementLearning.ipynb)  
Putting an agent in an environment to have it find the best path.
