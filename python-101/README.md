# Python 101
Look up on simple examples on how Python actually works using Jupyter Notebook.

## Tutorials
1. [Passing Data](../master/passingData.ipynb)  
Work with lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
2. [Control Flow Tools](../master/controlFlowTools.ipynb)  
Play with if-else statements and other built-in functions.
3. [Functions and Matrices](../master/functionsAndMatrices.ipynb)  
Passing parameters using functions and arguments.
4. [Genetic Algorithms](../master/geneticAlgorithms.ipynb)  
Discover how these algorithms iterate until the right answer.
5. [Ensemble Methods](../master/ensembleMethods.ipynb)  
We discover different ways of training a model here.
5. [Hidden Markov Model](../master/hiddenMarkovModel.ipynb)  
The model computes future sitautions without thinking of the past.
5. [Reinforcement Learning](../master/reinforcementLearning.ipynb)  
Putting an agent in an environment to have it find the best path.
